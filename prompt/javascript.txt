Write JavaScript code that implements this function and name it `solution`. Also, write tests for this function.

Finally, create 3 files:

1. `src/solution.js` (contains the implementation of the function)
2. `src/solution.test.js` (contains the implementation of tests)
3. `package.json` (contains information about the project and dependencies)

You need to build this code and run the tests.

Formulate the solution in the following format:

**package.json**
```json
Contents of package.json file
```

**src/solution.js**
```javascript
Contents of src/solution.js file
```

**src/solution.test.js**
```javascript
Contents of src/solution.test.js file
```


**Install**
```bash
Commands for install dependencies
```

**Test**
```bash
Commands for running tests
```

In the end, there will be 5 blocks: package.json, src/solution.js, src/solution.test.js, Install, Test
