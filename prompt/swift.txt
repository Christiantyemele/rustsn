Write Swift code that implements this function and name it `solution`. Also, write tests for this function.

Finally, create 3 files:

1. `Sources/Solution/Solution.swift` (contains the implementation of the function)
2. `Tests/SolutionTests/SolutionTests.swift` (contains the implementation of the tests)
2. `Package.swift` (contains information about the project and dependencies)

You need to build this code and run the tests.

Formulate the solution in the following format:

**Package.swift**
```swift
Contents of Package.swift file
```
**Sources/Solution/Solution.swift**
```swift
Contents of Sources/Solution/Solution.swift file
```
**Tests/SolutionTests/SolutionTests.swift**
```swift
Contents of Tests/SolutionTests/SolutionTests.swift file
```

**Compile**
```bash
Commands for compile code with tests
```

**Test**
```bash
Commands for running tests
```

In the end, there will be 5 blocks: Package.swift, "Sources/Solution/Solution.swift","Tests/SolutionTests/SolutionTests.swift", Compile, Test
